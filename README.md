# Kaggle Competiton 
Projects of Data mining class (Kaggle Competitions)
This folder contains my code writing in R markdown for Kaggle competitions:

1. DataHW#1: 
  https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques 
  With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, 
  this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
  
2. DataHW#2: https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity
o Created an algorithm to accurately predict claims severity for Allstate Insurance using the historical data set of 200,000 entries.
o Fine-tuned various models on the test data set and improved MAE by 5% on the test set.

3. DataHW#3: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit
o Developed and tested multiple classification models such as random forest, logistic, and gradient boosting to predict defaults
o Utilized 250,000 historical data to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years. In order to build a model that borrowers can use to help make the best financial decisions.
o Performed parameter tuning to optimize the model predicting power in R and improved the AUC by 10% on the test set.

4. DataHW#4: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors

5. DataHW#5: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

6. Data#Final: https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection
o Developed a Random Forest algorithm to predict actual downloads of a mobile app conditional on ad clicks.
o Worked on a data set of 200 million clicks with a huge volume of fraudulent/bot traffic to flag IP addresses which produced lots of clicks with zero conversion (app installation) rate.
o Achieved the accuracy of 88% on the test set.
